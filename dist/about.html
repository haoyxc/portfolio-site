          <!-- <h6>With a background of Anorexia</h6> -->
          <p>
            I struggled with anorexia when I was in 8th/9th grade and sure, it was a mess
            but I've learned so much about the importance of self-care and love (I'm sorry
            this is cheesy). It's definitely something that has shaped me into a more
            positive and open-minded person.

            Like, foods with a hole in the middle. I'm talking about bagels and donuts
            especially although I will not turn down cheerios once in a while!

          <!-- <h6>title</h6> -->
          <p>
            As an avid debater throughout all of high school, I always thought I would
            major in econ, IR, political science, or something like that and then go
            pre-law. I discovered during first semester of college I wasn't actually
            interested in that path. Sooo welcome to my coded website!
